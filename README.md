# EEI

My goal with this project has been to create an interactive user interface that would speed up common tasks I perform day to day on my pc.
It is made up of 7 parts:
1. Shortcut Window:
  -Here the user has 30 custom buttons that can be remapped to navigate to website urls, execute programs, or navigate shortcut paths.
  -Right click each to set an image value and a function.
2. Calendar Window:
  -This is an interactive calendar that will display the current date and is a nice way to keep track of your day to day tasks.
  -CLicking on a window will open up an interface where you can list tasks.
3. Notes Window:
  -Very simple to use page. Simply write any notes or things you wish to remember down and it will save it for later use.
4. ToDoLIst:
  -Interactive listbox control that allows the user to add items to the "todolist".
  -User may add/remove/deleteall/etc each item.
  -Connects to a local database. Will be updated to support multiple dbs in the future.
5. Stopwatch Window:
  -Easy to use stopwatch/countdown timer.
6. ClipBoard Window:
  -Basic listbox that stores items copied to the clipboard.
  -Pressing "ctrl+b" will paste the current clipboard item to listbox.
7. Customize Window:
  -Used to customize the appearance of the interface.
  -Opacity slider at bottom changes the opacity of the background.
